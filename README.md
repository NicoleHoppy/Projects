# Projects

I’m really excited to share this portfolio, where I’m starting to build and showcase my skills in data analysis. I’ve been diving into tools like Power BI, Excel, R, and SQL to collect, explore, and visualize data, all with the goal of helping make smarter decisions. Each project is a small step in my journey, showing how I tackle problems and focus on the details — and I can't wait to bring this energy and mindset into my first data analysis role!

Feel free to explore my projects — they highlight my skills and the way I tackle challenges!
