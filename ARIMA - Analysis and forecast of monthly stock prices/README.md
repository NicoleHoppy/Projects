# Introduction

While studying, I got really into data analysis - especially time series. This project is one I worked on using GRETL, where I used ARIME and SARIMA models to forecast sales.It was a great way to turn theory into something more hands-on and actually see how those models work in practice.

Feel free to check it out and see what insights I found!
