# 1. Introduction

While studying, I got really into data analysis - especially time series. This project is one I worked on using GRETL, where I used ARIME and SARIMA models to forecast sales.It was a great way to turn theory into something more hands-on and actually see how those models work in practice.

Feel free to check it out and see what insights I found!

# 2. Abstract

In this project my main goal is to use time series of interest to analyze and forecast. I have chosen monthly stock prices of a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor CD Projekt S.A. Firstly, I will introduce data and tell a little bit about important dates which were affecting this time series. Later I will conclude if this time series can be considered as a representation of stationary process. Next I will analyze correlogram and also use automatic criteria in order to identify test models. Then I will estimate those models using the training set and also check them, that is establish if residuals of those models can be considered as a realization of white noise process and also I will check whether the residuals are normally distributed or not. Finally I will forecast using those models and I will compare them to the real values of the test set. At the end I will summarize my observations

## 3. Introducing the data
